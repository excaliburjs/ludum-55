### Local Development

Updating your local copy with `git pull -r` to rebase your local commits on top of upstream, makes the `main` easy to follow and merges less difficult.

1. Clone the repo

        git clone https://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-55.git

2. Navigate into the root directory `ludum-55` in your favorite command line tool

3. Run the install to download the tools:

        npm install

4. Build the project:

        npm run build

5. Run the game locally with parcel:

        npm start

6. Make your changes, commit directly to the 'main' branch, update your local copy with `git pull -r`, and then push to the remote repository.
